# Visitor Information Collection System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

### 1. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Created a `Visitor` model with fields:
  - id (unique identifier)
  - firstName
  - lastName
  - email (unique - prevents duplicates)
  - companyName
  - phoneNumber
  - createdAt (automatic timestamp)
  - updatedAt (automatic timestamp)

### 2. Database Client (`lib/prisma.ts`)
- Singleton Prisma client for database connections
- Prevents multiple connections in development
- Optimized for production use

### 3. API Route (`app/api/visitors/route.ts`)
- **POST** endpoint: Saves visitor information
  - Validates all fields using Zod
  - Checks for duplicate emails
  - Returns success or error messages
- **GET** endpoint: Checks if visitor exists by email

### 4. Visitor Welcome Modal (`components/visitor-welcome-modal.tsx`)
- Beautiful modal dialog that appears on first visit
- Form with all required fields:
  - First Name
  - Last Name  
  - Email
  - Company Name
  - Phone Number
- Features:
  - Form validation with helpful error messages
  - Loading state during submission
  - "Skip for now" option
  - Uses localStorage to remember if user submitted/skipped
  - Shows toast notifications on success/error
  - Fully responsive design

### 5. Layout Integration (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Added VisitorWelcomeModal component to root layout
- Added Sonner toaster for notifications
- Modal appears on every page but only shows once per user

### 6. Documentation
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md`: Complete setup instructions
- `.env.example`: Template for environment variables

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User visits website for the first time
2. After 1 second, modal appears with welcome message
3. User fills out the form or clicks "Skip for now"
4. On submit:
   - Data is validated
   - Sent to API endpoint
   - Saved to Neon database
   - Success message shown
   - Modal closes
   - LocalStorage flag set (won't show again)
5. On skip:
   - Modal closes
   - LocalStorage flag set
   - Can still access site

### Technical Details:
- **Client-side**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Server-side**: API route with Prisma ORM
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **State Management**: localStorage for modal visibility
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components (shadcn/ui)
- **Notifications**: Sonner toast system

## Next Steps to Get This Working

### 1. Install Missing Dependencies
```bash
npm install prisma @prisma/client @neondatabase/serverless --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Set Up Neon Database
1. Go to https://console.neon.tech/
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your connection string

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create `.env` file:
```env
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-connection-string-here"
```

### 4. Initialize Database
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 5. Test the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000 and the modal should appear!

### 6. View Collected Data
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
This opens a browser interface to view all visitor submissions.

## Additional Features You Could Add

### 1. Admin Dashboard
Create a protected admin page to view all visitors:
- Total visitor count
- Recent submissions
- Export to CSV
- Search and filter

### 2. Email Notifications
Send email notifications when new visitors sign up:
- To admin
- Welcome email to visitor

### 3. Analytics Integration
Track visitor information in Google Analytics or similar.

### 4. GDPR Compliance
Add privacy policy link and consent checkbox.

### 5. Rate Limiting
Prevent spam submissions with rate limiting.

### 6. Custom Thank You Page
Redirect to a custom page after submission.
